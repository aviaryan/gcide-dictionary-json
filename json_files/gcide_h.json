Helium was first detected spectroscopically in the sun by Lockyer in 1868; it was first prepared by Ramsay in 1895. Helium has a density of 1.98 compared with hydrogen, and is more difficult to liquefy than the latter. Chemically, it is an inert noble gas, belonging to the argon group, and cannot be made to form compounds. The helium nucleus is the charged particle which constitutes alpha rays, and helium is therefore formed as a decomposition product of certain radioactive substances such as radium.  The normal helium nucleus has two protons and two neutrons, but an isotope with only one neutron is also observed in atmospheric helium at an abundance of 0.013 %.  Liquid helium has a boiling point of -268.9° C at atmospheric pressure, and is used for maintaining very low temperatures, both in laboratory experimentation and in commercial applications to maintain superconductivity in low-temperature superconducting devices.

A horse latitude is created because warm, wet air near the equator rises, cools, and drops its moisture in heavy rains (creating tropical rainforest areas near the equator). By the time the air reaches the high altitudes, it is cold and dry and can not rise further, so it spreads out and moves toward the poles and near the 30° north and 30° south, it begins to sink toward the earth's surface., preventing moisture from reaching the area from elsewhere.

Many of the worlds deserts are found at these latitudes"
