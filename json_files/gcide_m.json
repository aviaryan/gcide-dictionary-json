It became independent on November 17, 1991, after a referendum held on September 9, 1991.  Its capital city is Skopje.  The currency is the Denar. The ethnic composition is approximately 65% Macedonians, 21.73% Albanians, 3.79 Turks, 2.56% Romanians, 2.10% Serbs, and 0.38% Vlachs.  Its language is Macedonian, which  uses the Cyrillic alphabet.  Its second largest city is Bitola (pop. 84,002).\n    At independence in 1991 a new Constitution was adopted, which proclaimed the Republic of Macedonia a sovereign and independent state.   On april 8, 1993, the Republic of Macedonia became a member of the United Nations Organization. Due to the pressure of Greece, which was concerned about possible claims on part of its territory, it was admitted under the name of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.\n    The Republic of Macedonia is situated in the center of the the Balkan Peninsula and has a unique strategic position at the junction of the main routes which have for millenia linked the West to the Orient. It covers an area of  25,713 square killometres and borders with Bulgaria to the east, Greece to the south, Albania to the west and Serbia to the north.  With the 1913 treaty of  Bucharest, the territory of Macedonia, mainly populated with macedonians, was divided between Greece, Serbia and Bulgaria.  Vardar Macedonia (the territory of today's Republic of Macedonia) became part of the newly established Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes - later known as the Kingdom of Yugoslavia - which existed until 1941. The larger part of Macedonia, geographically known as Aegean Macedonia, covering an area  of 34,356 sqare kilometres, was incorporated into Greece.  The territory of Pirin Macedonia (6,798 sqare kilometres) was assigned to Bulgaria.\n    In World War II Macedonians started to struggle against the fascist occupiers on October 11, 1941.  The First Session of ASNOM (The Anti-Fascist Assembly of the National Liberation of Macedonia) was held on August 2, 1944.  It finally crowned the process of the historical establishment of the Macedonian state and was the basis for its soveregnity, and integrity.  Macedonia (Socialistic Republic of Macedonia) became part of Tito's Yugoslavia and remained part until independence in 1991",

It was discovered in 1907 by Otto Hahn as a decay product of thorium (produced by decay of thorium-232).  Mesothorium-1 (radium-228) in turn produces actinium-228 (mesothorium-2) as the first product of its radioactive decay, and the actinium-228 in turn decays quickly (half-life of 6 hours) to thorium-228 (which is also called radiothorium; the thorium-228 has a half-life of 1.91 years, shorter than that of the radium-228).  It was discovered and named before full recognition of the nature of isotopes of the elements, and was distinguished from other variants of radium by its half-life and mode of production and decay.  It was also cheaper to prepare than other short-lived radium isotopes, and was thus sold commercially, for use, e.g. in making watch dials readable in the dark by painting the hands and hour marks with a self-luminous paint containing the radioactive substance; it is therefore often referred to (e.g. in regulatory legislation) as though distinct from radium.  It was one of the isotopes believed responsible for radiation-induced diseases observed in industrial workers who painted radium on watch dials in the late 1950's and early 1960's.  The primary isotope of radium (radium-226) has a half-life of 1620 years, and these isotopes with shorter half-lives proved difficult to isolate and study for the purpose of finding the cause of such diseases"

From this are formed the are, the liter, the stere, the gram, etc. These units, and others derived from them, are divided decimally, and larger units are formed from multiples by 10, 100, 1,000, and 10,000.  The successive multiplies are designated by the prefixes, deka- (formerly deca-), hecto-, kilo-, and myria- (seldom used); successive parts by deci-, centi-, and milli-.  The prefixes mega- and micro- are used to denote a multiple by one million, and the millionth part, respectively; giga- and nano- denote multiples of one billion (1,000,000,000) and one billionth, respectively.  The prefix for one trillion (1012) is tera, and for one trillionth (10-12) is pico;  for one quintillion (1015) peta, and for (10-15) (one quintillionth) femto;  for (10-18) atto.

Thus, ethyl alcohol can also be written as CH3.CH2.OH or CH3-CH2-OH, in which the period or dash between functional groups indicates a single bond between the principle atoms of each group.  This formula shows that in ethyl alcohol, the carbon of a methyl group (CH3-) is attached to the carbon of a methylene group (-CH2-), which is attached to the oxygen of a hydroxyl group (-OH).  A structural formula is a graphical depiction of the relative positions of atoms in a molecule, and may be very complicated"
